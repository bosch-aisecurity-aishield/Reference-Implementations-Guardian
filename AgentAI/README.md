# 🤖 Agentic AI Security 🛡️

Agentic AI, or AI agents that operate autonomously, offer great potential in fields from data analysis to automated decision-making. However, the power of these AI systems makes security essential to prevent misuse and ensure compliance.

## 🔐  Why Secure Agentic AI?

Ensuring safety in agentic AI protects sensitive data, enforces ethical guidelines, and prevents harmful outputs. By integrating security measures, we ensure AI systems operate within trusted boundaries.

## 💻 Reference Implementation

For a secure agentic AI setup, you can explore integrations like **CrewAI** and **Phidata** with **Guardian API** to monitor compliance and guardrail interactions.

- **CrewAI** : [GuardedCrew](Crewai_Agent_Example) implementation with example of project planning crew
- **Phidata** : [GuardedAgentWorkflow](PhiData_Agent_Examples) implementation with the financial agent workflow
- **Microsoft AutoGen** : [MonitorRoundRobinGroupChat](Microsoft_Autogen_Example) implementation with travel planning agents
